```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email_for_notifications
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment

1. Set up your environment variables in the server's `.env` file
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project (if needed): `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

### Frontend Deployment

1. Set up your environment variables in the client's `.env` file
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Deploy the build folder to your hosting provider

## Important Notes for Deployment

- Make sure your MongoDB instance is accessible from your deployment environment
- The `FRONTEND_URL` in the server's `.env` must match your actual frontend domain for CORS to work correctly
- The `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in the client's `.env` must point to your actual backend domain
- For local development, you can use the default values (localhost)
- Remember to restart both server and client after changing environment variables

## Security Features

- IP-based attendance tracking to prevent proxy attendance
